It was not a new book for me.  No, I had heard about the book before.  And I also had heard the praise for the book.  I knew it was popular.  My roommate, Aman had said many good things about the book.  And it was one of the books I would see at bookstores, and even in the stationary shops.  I would see it everywhere: and I mean, everywhere!  People would mention that book, would recommend that book, and I would see people reading that book.  However, I just did not feel like reading it.  It just was not the right time.</p>\n<p>Back then, I don't recall if I knew the meaning of 'alchemist', and I did not know why the cover photo of the book featured pyramids.  Frankly, I never truly liked the cover of this book, which you can see in the above photo.  There are some books which I would like to collect, to own.  Some of them because they have a beautiful cover.  There is an art of designing the cover, which I really appreciate. And I happen to like this cover more:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1466865542l/18144590._SY475_.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of the 25th anniversary edition of *The Alchemist*\"><br>\n<em>The 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary cover of \"The Alchemist\" which I really prefer.</em></p>\n<p>Now that is something I would prefer over the other. It is so much better. But, I was not fortunate to hold and feel this cover. Somehow I never felt any temptation to buy that book, didn't feel any affinity towards it. And neither did I have any affinity to hurt my eyes reading it on my laptop.</p>\n<p>This time, I went with the audiobook. The audiobook was narrated by Jeremy Irons, the voice of Scar (from <em>The Lion King</em>). I went for the audiobook because I would not have seen myself sitting down and reading <em>The Alchemist</em>, when I can instead read something I really want to.</p>\n<p><em>The Alchemist</em> starts with a short story about Narcissus and the lake.  And in just those paragraphs, I found myself gripped with the story.  It had my attention.  It got me interested.  I really could feel the excitement of feeling ‘Oh, what happens next?’</p>\n<p>Right before I read <em>The Alchemist</em>, I had read <em>I am Malala</em> by Malala Yousafzai, <em>Sex and Lies</em> by Leïla Slimani, and then, <em>Headscarves and Hymens</em> by Mona Eltahawy.  I could partly visualise the life in Swat Valley (Malala described it in a vivid manner).  However, the next two books, <em>Sex and Lies</em>, as well as <em>Headscarves and Hymens</em> were journalistic: and had multiple narrations, which I could not visualise in my head.  There was a scene of female genital mutilation in the latter, and I was just shivering reading that.  It was grotesque and barbaric.  I can't get the imagery out of my head.  However, there was no element of surprise in any of the three books, after all, they were not suspense or adventure.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Alchemist</em>, however, the tone of writing, and Jeremy Irons' voice made me want to know more about it.  I was not dying to know what happens next, but I was curious.  I really like when that happens, which is not too often.  Thinking about it, I did not feel the same way when I was reading <em>Siddartha</em> by Herman Hesse.  What a lovely book it was.</p>\n<p><em>The Alchemist</em>'s story starts in South of Spain, in Andalusia.  I happen to watch Spanish football and have a rough idea of the map.  I could visualise the days of Santiago, the protagonist of this story, who is a shepherd.  In the beginning the story tells what he wanted to do, and why he became a shepherd: for his love of travelling.  He learns a lot from observing the sheep, and the nature around him.  He draws patterns, and then he is inspired by a couple of people to go live his legend.  His legend is to find treasure in Egypt.  Santiago, a name which I associate with a Latin American, more than a Spaniard, travels to Africa from Gibraltar.  I assume he reaches Morocco.  I could visualise the places in my head, though I have never travelled to those distant lands.  Multiple times, I was impressed by the imagery Paulo Coelho's words, and Jeremy Irons' voice drew in my mind.  It felt so real.  The culture and tradition of those countries -- quite frankly, it felt true.  The references to the religion, the culture and tradition, it felt honest.  Santiago is deceived in the foreign land, and wants to give up.  However, he can't just go back to his life.  He decides to not give up and instead, earn his way out.  He spends many months working for someone and learns so much in that time.  When he could finally go back to his home, he is instead motivated to continue living his legend.  He sets for the pyramids.  Multiple times he has lost his path, multiple times people have mentored him, and helped him to focus on his mission.  He falls in love, he learns about what he ought to do, he makes some difficult choices: Santiago is at times, at the mercy of people who could kill him instantly, but finally becomes the alchemist.  He learns an alchemist does not spend his life turning lead to gold just like that.  When lead has served it purpose being lead, and finally wants to live its legend of being a gold, that is when the alchemist transforms it.</p>\n<p>I was mesmerised by the word choices, the description, the translation (After all, <em>The Alchemist</em> was originally written in Portuguese), and Jeremy Irons' voice.  These days, authors narrate their own book.  Some have a great voice, some show great interest.  In this case, where it was narrated by someone else, narrating a translated work, I could finally grow to appreciate how important it is for a narrator to enjoy this story before narrating.  It is an allegory, but I didn't read it as one.  I read it as an adventure, and as a fantasy, and I liked it in that way.  Soon after I had read it, I felt Aman overhyped it, for the praise he had for the book.  But truth to be told, I never asked him why he liked the book so much.  Maybe now that I have read the book, I can ask him!</p>\n<p>It is not a book I wanted to actively read, nor is the book I will actively read.  It is well-written, true.  Not out-of-this-world, but a simple book, which many love.  I don't love this book.  I liked it.  And I will, one day inshā'llah, I might re-read it, and read it in a new light.  And then have a different perspective on it.</p>\n<p>If you want to read this book, I will say, it is a simple book.  It does not hold a mantra of \"following your heart\".  It does not try to be larger than life.  I think I enjoyed reading it as fantasy adventure, and would not have enjoyed it as an allegory.  Maybe read it once.  Have a shot at it.  I wish to learn Portuguese, to better enjoy <em>O Alquimista</em>.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":"Paulo Coelho","lang":"en","path":"/i-finally-read-the-alchemist","tags":["Adventure","Fiction","Fantasy"],"title":"I finally read The Alchemist"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://acagastya.github.io/book-reviews"}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/i-finally-read-the-alchemist"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1805982026","2693727628"]}
